# Skeleton for simple HTML/JS projects

Includes Gulp to compile Sass into CSS, along with Autoprefixer and Browser Sync.

## Setup

Before starting, you'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes NPM).

Clone this repo, then run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Usage

Edit CSS (Sass) and JavaScript in the `src/` folder. The Gulp script will process these and the stylesheets and javascripts folders will be automatically populated.

The command `gulp` will build the site, generating the CSS in the stylesheets folder, as well as combining JavaScript files into the javascripts folder.
